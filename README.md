# Network topology - Assignment

In this assignment you will compute network toplogy properties of
a model of Escherichia coli's central carbon metabolism. 

In `assignment.py`:

1. Compute a binary version of the stoichiometry matrix S.
2. Compute the reaction adjacency matrix.
3. Compute the compound adjacency matrix.
4. Determine the most connected metabolite.
5. Determine in how many reactions the metabolite atp_c participates in.
6. Determine how many metabolites the reactions ACALD and ALCD2x share.
7. Determine the top 10 list of most connected metabolites.

Hints:
* `assignment.py` contains a few hints in the comments to each task
